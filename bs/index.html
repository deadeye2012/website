        With Broadsign, we have the enhanced flexibility, creative capabilities, and planning tools we need to make
        <br />
        connections more efficiently and cohesively across our network.<br />Using Broadsign's rule-based automation
        made it easier for us to focus on campaign <br/> features rather than the software itself.
